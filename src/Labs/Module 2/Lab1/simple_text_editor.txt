Create a text editor using commands

You are developing a text editor that allows users to perform various operations on the text using the "CustomStack" class.
The class supports the following operations:

insert(value): Inserts a string of characters at the current cursor position in the text.
delete(value): Deletes the last value characters from the text starting from the current cursor position.
get(value): Retrieves the character at index value from the text and displays it.
undo(): Reverts the last executed command on the text.
Each command is represented by a string in the following format:

1.Command 1: '1 value' - Inserts the string value at the current cursor position in the text.
2.Command 2: '2 value' - Deletes the last value characters from the text starting from the current cursor position.
3.Command 3: '3 value' - Retrieves the character at index value from the text and displays it.
4.Command 4: '4' - Reverts the last executed command on the text.

Consider a scenario where you have a text editor with a "CustomStack" class that implements the required operations. Assume the initial text is empty.


Exercise-1

3 3 -> command and index of the stack

Output:
c
a



Exercise-2
